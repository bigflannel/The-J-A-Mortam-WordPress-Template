# Features and Use

### Classic Editor

The theme is currently only tested with the Classic Editor:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/

It does appear to work with a Classic Formatting Box using the Gutenberg Editor, but I am not sure to what extent. I will be updating it in the future to be compatible with Gutenberg.

### WordPress Media Settings

Recommended settings:

Thumbnail 1200 x 300
[uncheck crop thumbnail]
Medium 2400 x 600
Large 4800 x 1200

### Posts

The inspiration for this theme is the work of J A Mortram. It is designed to encourage readers to go through a story and then read on about that subject or return to the main index of stories. The single post page does not have next and previous post navigation, instead it features tags as navigation at the end of the post. Single post or photo story subjects are best grouped in the theme using a post's tags.

### Post Format : Gallery

Use this format to activate fullscreen image display on a post (in those browsers that support it). All images in the post must be uploaded through the post, if you want to use an image in two posts with format gallery, you must upload the image twice. The 'Link URL' field for an added image must be empty.

### Menu Options

The theme can display three menus, one below the header ('Header') and two before the page footer ('Donate' and 'Footer'). In the footer, if it exists, 'Donate' is shown first, then 'Footer'. 'Footer' displays the default menu if none are set. Current items or their ancestors are marked in the menu with a bottom border. Drop-down rollover menus are supported: when using these, be mindful to make the top link a custom link with target URL '#' so mobile users can click to open the drop-down.

### Widget Options

The default widget in the footer is search, widgets you add will replace it and be stacked vertically.

### Footer Copyright

Set the text displayed after the footer copyright text (Â© 2013) using theme settings and 'Copyright Statement for Footer'.
