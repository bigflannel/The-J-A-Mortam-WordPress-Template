# Features and Use

### WordPress Media Settings

Recommended settings:

### Post Format : Gallery

Use this format to activate fullscreen image display on a post (in those browsers that support it). All images in the post must be uploaded through the post, if you want to use an image in two posts with format gallery, you must upload the image twice.

The theme can display two menus before the page footer: 'donate' and 'site'. If it exists, 'donate' is shown first, then 'site'. 'Site' displays the default menu if none set.

### Footer Copyright

Set the text displayed after the footer copyright text (Â© 2013) using theme settings and 'Copyright Statement for Footer'.
